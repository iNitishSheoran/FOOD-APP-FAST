## 🚀 Project Overview

**Food App Fast** is a frontend application built using **ReactJS** and bundled with **Parcel**. It fetches real-time restaurant and food data from Swiggy’s public API and renders a dynamic, component-based UI.

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of **React hooks**, **data fetching**, and **component-based design** through hands-on experience.
